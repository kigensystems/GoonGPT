# GoonGPT - Comprehensive Deployment Checklist

## 🚨 PROJECT STATUS: NOT READY FOR DEPLOYMENT 🚨

**CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**: 22 TypeScript build errors, exposed API keys, missing authentication
**Security Risk Level**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time to Fix**: 3-5 days minimum

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS)

<!-- ### Build Failures - MUST FIX FIRST
- [ ] **22 TypeScript compilation errors** preventing production build
  - HowItWorksStepper.tsx: Missing JSX namespace import
  - Multiple route parameter type mismatches
  - Unused variables and imports across codebase
  - Tier level type handling inconsistencies -->


<!-- ### Security Breaches - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
- [ ] **EXPOSED API KEY in repository** - CRITICAL SECURITY BREACH
  - API key `8T7epBUsmItayhWCvkQPoWob5yBMFonDHpXpamtgovfciJEt4L6UKjfHINYJ` is committed in .env
  - [ ] Delete .env from git history immediately
  - [ ] Regenerate ModelsLab API key (current key compromised)
  - [ ] Configure environment variables in Netlify only -->

<!-- ### Runtime Errors - COMPLETE SYSTEM FAILURE
- [ ] **Crypto import bug in database.js** - ALL AUTHENTICATION WILL FAIL
  - File: `netlify/functions/utils/database.js:105`
  - Uses `crypto.randomUUID()` without importing crypto module
  - Impact: Complete authentication system breakdown

### Missing Authentication & Security
- [ ] No rate limiting on API endpoints (unlimited abuse possible)
- [ ] CORS set to allow all origins (`*`) - security vulnerability
- [ ] No input validation for user-generated content
- [ ] Missing authentication middleware in Netlify functions -->

## Known Issues & Workarounds ⚠️


### Critical Frontend UI/UX Issues

2. **Video Mode Integration Completely Broken**
   - Problem: Video mode in App.tsx doesn't properly render VideoContainer
   - Impact: Users can select video mode but get broken/incomplete interface
   - Root Cause: Two competing architectural approaches (App.tsx vs Container components)
   - Priority: **CRITICAL**

2. **Inconsistent Component Architecture**
   - Problem: App.tsx reimplements logic that exists in ChatContainer
   - Impact: Code duplication, maintenance nightmare, inconsistent behavior
   - Details: Chat logic exists in both App.tsx and ChatContainer component
   - Priority: **HIGH**

3. **Confusing Mode Switching UX**
   - Problem: Duplicate mode toggles, unclear context preservation
   - Impact: Users get lost switching between modes, unclear state management
   - Details: Mode toggle appears twice, no clear indication of what happens to conversation
   - Priority: **HIGH**

4. **Inconsistent Submit Button Patterns**
   - Problem: Three different submit button designs across components
   - Details: ChatInput (circular bubble), VideoInput (circular bubble), DeepFakeInput (full-width button)
   - Status: ChatInput recently fixed, DeepFakeInput still inconsistent
   - Priority: **MEDIUM**

5. **Video Upload UX Problems**
   - Problem: Video mode requires image upload but this isn't clearly communicated
   - Impact: Users confused about workflow, no clear progress for 30-60 second generation
   - Details: Upload flow disconnected from main chat interface
   - Priority: **HIGH**

6. **Duplicate Input Handling**
   - Problem: App.tsx has its own input state AND uses separate input components
   - Impact: Potential state sync issues, confusing code paths
   - Details: Two different submit handlers and input fields in some views
   - Priority: **MEDIUM**

7. **Mobile UX Issues**
   - Problem: File upload components, mode toggles not optimized for mobile
   - Impact: Poor mobile experience for core features
   - Details: Small touch targets, image/video preview sizing issues
   - Priority: **MEDIUM**

8. **Navigation & State Management**
   - Problem: No clear "back" or "reset" functionality between modes
   - Impact: Users can get stuck in modes without clear escape path
   - Details: No breadcrumbs, unclear state transitions
   - Priority: **MEDIUM**

### Critical Development & Quality Issues

9. **Zero Test Coverage**
   - Problem: No unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests
   - Impact: No safety net for deployments, bugs will reach production
   - Risk: Broken features, regression bugs, poor code quality
   - Priority: **HIGH**

10. **No Rate Limiting or Abuse Prevention**
    - Problem: No API rate limiting on expensive AI operations
    - Impact: Could be exploited for DDoS attacks or high API costs
    - Risk: Unlimited usage could bankrupt the project
    - Priority: **HIGH**

11. **No Content Validation or Sanitization**
    - Problem: User inputs passed directly to AI without validation
    - Impact: Potential for injection attacks, malformed requests
    - Risk: Security vulnerabilities, API errors
    - Priority: **HIGH**

12. **No Error Boundaries in React**
    - Problem: Uncaught errors could crash entire app
    - Impact: Poor user experience, difficult debugging
    - Priority: **MEDIUM**

13. **No Monitoring or Analytics**
    - Problem: No error tracking, usage analytics, or performance monitoring
    - Impact: Blind to production issues, user behavior, costs
    - Priority: **MEDIUM**

14. **Accessibility Issues**
    - Problem: No keyboard navigation, screen reader support, or ARIA labels
    - Impact: Excludes users with disabilities, potential legal issues
    - Priority: **MEDIUM**

### Backend & Infrastructure Issues

15. **Missing Features from Pricing Page**
   - Problem: Many advertised features aren't implemented
   - Missing: Text-to-3D, voice features, 2K/4K upscaling, batch operations
   - Impact: False advertising, disappointed users
   - Priority: **HIGH**

10. **Database Production Scaling**
    - Problem: Uses simple file storage in dev, Netlify Blobs in prod
    - Limitation: No complex queries, relationships, or analytics
    - Priority: **MEDIUM** (acceptable for MVP)

### Performance Considerations

1. **ModelsLab API Latency**
   - Video generation: 30-60 seconds
   - Image generation: 2-5 seconds
   - DeepFake: 10-30 seconds
   - Chat: 1-3 seconds

2. **Phantom Wallet Firefox Issues**
   - Firefox users may need popup blocker configuration
   - Warning component already implemented

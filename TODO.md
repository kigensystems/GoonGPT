## Current Task  
- [ ] Test the fix with all modes to verify UI consistency
- [ ] Verify all functionality works correctly across modes

## Completed - Component Refactoring (40% App.tsx Reduction)
- [x] Hook validation pipeline implemented
- [x] CLAUDE.md established with standards
- [x] **Extracted AppHeader component** from App.tsx (74 lines removed)
  - Reduced App.tsx from 803 to ~730 lines
  - Created reusable AppHeader with proper TypeScript interfaces
  - Centralized header logic (auth, navigation, external links)
- [x] **Extracted WelcomeScreen component** from App.tsx (213 lines removed)
  - Reduced App.tsx from ~730 to ~520 lines (283 lines total reduction)
  - Created comprehensive WelcomeScreen with 17 props interface
  - Handles all welcome state, mode switching, and inputs
- [x] **Extracted PageRouter component** from App.tsx (40+ lines removed)
  - Reduced App.tsx from ~520 to ~480 lines (323 lines total reduction)
  - Created reusable useCurrentView hook for route detection
  - Centralized all page routing logic in dedicated component
- [x] **Fixed suggestion pill positioning** in ChatContainer and ImageContainer
  - Moved suggestion pills below input to match WelcomeScreen layout
  - Ensured consistent UI/UX between welcome and active chat states
  - Verified build passes and functionality preserved

## Completed - UI Inconsistencies Fixed
- [x] **Video mode missing suggestion pills** in WelcomeScreen (mode === 'video' case missing)
- [x] **Video mode missing instructions** in VideoContainer (upload instruction + yellow warning box)
- [x] **Video mode UI consistency** between welcome and active states verified

## Completed - Architectural Consolidation (Phase 1 & 2)
- [x] **Created UnifiedContainer Architecture** - Eliminates 70%+ code duplication
  - UnifiedContainer: Main container accepting mode prop (134 lines)
  - EmptyState: Reusable welcome screen for all modes (118 lines)
  - MessageList: Generic message renderer for all message types (32 lines)
  - InputArea: Mode toggle + input wrapper (23 lines)
- [x] **Migrated ChatContainer** - 89% code reduction (253 → 27 lines)
  - Now thin wrapper delegating to UnifiedContainer
  - All functionality preserved, build passes
  - Proves architectural pattern works

## Completed - Phase 3: Complete Migration (88% Code Reduction)
- [x] **Migrated ImageContainer** to use UnifiedContainer (277 → 30 lines, 89% reduction)
- [x] **Migrated VideoContainer** to use UnifiedContainer (264 → 26 lines, 90% reduction)
- [x] **Migrated AsmrContainer** to use UnifiedContainer (141 → 22 lines, 84% reduction)
- [x] **Migrated DeepFakeContainer** to use UnifiedContainer (155 → 25 lines, 84% reduction)
- [x] **All containers now use UnifiedContainer** - Total: ~1,090 → ~130 lines
- [x] **Build passes successfully** - No TypeScript errors
- [x] **Bundle size reduced** from 614.32kB to 587.92kB (26kB smaller)

## Completed - Bug Fixes (UI Consistency Restored)
- [x] **Fixed suggestion pill inconsistency** between empty and active states
  - Image mode: Restored "Hot Korean Girl", "Placeholder 2", "Placeholder 3" in active state
  - Removed inconsistent "Anime style", "Cyberpunk scene" pills
  - Chat mode: Made pills consistent between welcome and active states
- [x] **Added missing suggestion pills** for all modes in active state
  - Video mode: "Make them dance", "Make them talk", "Make them walk"
  - ASMR mode: "Sweet whispers", "Counting slowly", "Bedtime story"
  - All modes now show suggestion pills when messages exist (not just chat/image)
- [x] **Restored missing disclaimer** in active state
  - Footer disclaimer now shows in both welcome and active states
  - Maintains consistent UI experience across all states
- [x] **Build passes successfully** - No TypeScript errors

## Next Steps: Verification & Cleanup
- [ ] **Test all modes** to verify UI consistency is fully restored
- [ ] **Update App.tsx** to use simplified container pattern (if needed)
- [ ] **Remove old WelcomeScreen component** (functionality moved to EmptyState)
- [ ] **Test end-to-end functionality** for each mode
- [ ] **Extract Custom Hooks** for state management
  - sendMessage, sendVideo, sendAsmr, sendDeepfake functions
  - Mode state management and switching logic
  - Message state and synchronization
- [ ] **Component Optimization**
  - Break down large container components
  - Implement proper memoization where needed
  - Consider lazy loading for container components

## Future Improvements (Post-Consolidation)
- [ ] **Extract Custom Hooks** for state management
  - sendMessage, sendVideo, sendAsmr, sendDeepfake functions
  - Mode state management and switching logic
  - Message state and synchronization
- [ ] **Component Optimization**
  - Break down large container components further if needed
  - Implement proper memoization where needed
  - Consider lazy loading for container components

## Development Standards
- [x] Automate Claude subagent workflows
- [x] Implement architectural consolidation workflows
- [x] Maintain CLAUDE.md compliance in all changes

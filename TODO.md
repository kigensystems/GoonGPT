## Current Task  
- [ ] Monitor production for any remaining issues
- [ ] Consider implementing request queuing for better UX

## Cleanup - Unused Code Removal

### Components Deleted âœ… (Replaced by UnifiedContainer)
- [x] Deleted `src/components/AsmrContainer.tsx` - Replaced by UnifiedContainer
- [x] Deleted `src/components/AsmrInput.tsx` - Not imported anywhere
- [x] Deleted `src/components/ChatContainer.tsx` - Replaced by UnifiedContainer
- [x] Deleted `src/components/DeepFakeContainer.tsx` - Replaced by UnifiedContainer
- [x] Deleted `src/components/ImageContainer.tsx` - Replaced by UnifiedContainer
- [x] Deleted `src/components/UserProfile.tsx` - Not imported anywhere (duplicate of ProfilePage)
- [x] Deleted `src/components/VideoContainer.tsx` - Replaced by UnifiedContainer

### Index Files Deleted âœ… (Orphaned)
- [x] Deleted `src/components/chat/index.ts` - Exports unused components, never imported
- [x] Deleted `src/components/video/index.ts` - Exports unused components, never imported

### Utilities Deleted âœ…
- [x] Deleted `src/utils/deepfakeClient.ts` - Never imported despite deepfake UI existing

### Backend Files Addressed âœ…
- [x] Deleted `netlify/functions/validate-session.js` - Never called from frontend
- [x] Verified `netlify/functions/image.mjs` exists - imageClient works correctly (Netlify serves .mjs as /image endpoint)

### Impact
- Removing ~1,500+ lines of unused code
- All functionality preserved through UnifiedContainer architecture
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## Critical Issues Found - Frontend & Backend Analysis

### Frontend Issues - High Priority ðŸ”´
- [ ] **Fix ID collision risk** - Replace Date.now().toString() with uuid/nanoid (App.tsx: lines 90, 103, 218, 230, 293, 350)
- [ ] **Fix race conditions** - Use functional setState for all message updates in App.tsx
- [ ] **Add isProcessing protection** to sendVideo and sendAsmr functions
- [ ] **Add HTML sanitization** for message content to prevent XSS

### Frontend Issues - Medium Priority ðŸŸ¡
- [ ] **Replace alert() calls** with toast notifications (found in 12+ components)
- [ ] **Fix memory leaks** - Clean up setTimeout in EarnableActionCard.tsx:64, UserRegistration.tsx:52, AsmrMessage.tsx:52
- [ ] **Add feature-specific error boundaries** for better error isolation

### Frontend Issues - Low Priority ðŸŸ¢
- [ ] **Reduce TokenDashboard polling** from 2s to 10s+ (TokenDashboard.tsx:64)
- [ ] **Centralize file validation** logic across upload components
- [ ] **Add loading states** for profile updates and token earnings

### Backend Issues - Critical Security ðŸš¨
- [ ] **Fix error detail exposure** - Remove error.message from production (asmr.js:184, auth-wallet.js:132)
- [ ] **Remove sensitive console.logs** exposing API keys (chat.js:14-17, asmr.js:32-36)
- [ ] **Add SQL injection prevention** - Use parameterized queries
- [ ] **Fix CORS headers** - Don't use request origin directly (chat.js:39)
- [ ] **Add request size limits** to prevent DoS attacks

### Backend Issues - High Priority ðŸ”´
- [ ] **Add comprehensive error handling** - Wrap all async handlers in try-catch
- [ ] **Fix ID collision in video.js** - Line 57 uses Date.now() for track_id

### Backend Issues - Medium Priority ðŸŸ¡
- [ ] **Fix memory leak in rateLimiter** - setInterval runs forever (line 10)
- [ ] **Add Content-Type validation** before JSON.parse()

### Backend Issues - Low Priority ðŸŸ¢
- [ ] **Standardize error response format** across all functions

- [ ] **Test end-to-end functionality** for each mode
- [ ] **Extract Custom Hooks** for state management
